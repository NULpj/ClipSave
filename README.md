# ClipSave
Clip Save is similar to a regular clipboard, but it operates within the command prompt (CMD). It allows you to save text snippets along with the date and time of the save. Unlike traditional clipboards, there's no need to pin the content to prevent it from disappearing. The clip remains permanent unless manually deleted.
